Scraping offers from multi websites into one easy-readable report + IT hiring trends analytics.


For early casual use:

0. Download files into 1 folder. Add Beautifull Soap into the folder (fg. https://github.com/waylan/beautifulsoup )
1. Edit words(ones in "") in "my_words" file (ones to gather, for analytics and to look for) [whole file]
2. Edit words in "Report_gen" file (ones you look for) [lines 20-64]
3. Set your searches (job/location/max num of offers) in "Init" file [lines 14-23]
4. Run Init.py

This is early version for self use only, so all feedback is wellcome.

Future (maybe):
1. Deploy on server -> automatic reports every month/week
2. Deploy on website (?) with some sexy frontend maybe? maybe.
3. Bug fixes, code tidying (???)
4. Trend Analytics with sexy plots
5. Natural Language processing.

Special thanks to Kutylowska and Szatan (my early math teachers) for being cool xD
