In the name of my early math teachers. 

Scraping offers from multi websites into one easy-readable report + IT hiring trends analytics.


For early casual use:
1. Edit words(ones in "") in "my_words" file (ones to gather, for analytics and to look for) [whole file]
2. Edit words in "Report_gen" file (ones you look for) [lines 20-64]
3. Edit initial data in "Init" file [lines 14-23]

This is early version for self use only, so all feedback is wellcome.

Cheers!
